Data Driven Discovery implementation from New York University - TA2
===================================================================

This repository is part of NYU's implementation of the D3M project. It holds the TA2 system (pipeline generation and execution) based on [VisTrails](https://github.com/VisTrails/VisTrails). A separate location holds our TA3 implementation, based on [VisFlow](https://github.com/yubowenok/visflow).
