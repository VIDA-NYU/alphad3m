Welcome to AlphaD3M's documentation!
======================================

AlphaD3M is an AutoML system that automatically searches for models and derives end-to-end pipelines that read,
pre-process the data, and train the model. AlphaD3M leverages recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and is
able to adapt to different application domains and problems through incremental learning.

AlphaD3M provides data scientists and data engineers the flexibility to address complex problems by leveraging the
Python ecosystem, including open-source libraries and tools, support for collaboration, and infrastructure that enables
transparency and reproducibility.
